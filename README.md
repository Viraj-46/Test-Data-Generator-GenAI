-------------------------------------Test Data Generator---------------------------------


So to ensure any code generated by an LLM/GenAI you need to ensure its working, to need to run you need to have the schemas that it references.

This use case:
1. Parses your script either with LLM or Conventional programming
2. Collects the Schemas
3. Uses LLM to generate Random yet accurate records based on the datatypes
4. Connects with DB to create the schemas/ Insert data.
5. Voila.... you can now test yout script!!!!

---------------------------------------File Details----------------------------------------

1. "snowflake_testdata_gen.py" has and end-to-end POC ready to use for Snowflake SQL scripts
2. "conventional_xml_parser.py" has a conventional parser built for XML/Informatic (ETL mappings)-----> Can be extended using similar methods given in snowflake POC
